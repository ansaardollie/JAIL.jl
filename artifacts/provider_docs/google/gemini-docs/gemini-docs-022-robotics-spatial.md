Gemini Robotics ER models can point to objects, track them in video, detect
them with bounding boxes, and generate movement trajectories.

For full runnable code, see the
[Robotics cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/robotics-samples/blob/main/Getting%20Started/gemini_robotics_er.ipynb).

## Point to objects

The following example finds specific objects in an image and returns their
normalized `[y, x]` coordinates:

### Python

    from google import genai

    PROMPT = """
              Point to no more than 10 items in the image. The label returned
              should be an identifying name for the object detected.
              The answer should follow the json format: [{"point": <point>,
              "label": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format
              normalized to 0-1000.
            """
    client = genai.Client()

    uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file="my-image.png")

    image_response = client.interactions.create(
        model="gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
        input=[
            {
                "type": "image",
                "uri": uploaded_file.uri,
                "mime_type": uploaded_file.mime_type
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": PROMPT}
        ],
        generation_config={"thinking_level": "high"},
    )

    print(image_response.output_text)

### REST

    # First, ensure you have the image file locally.
    # Encode the image to base64
    IMAGE_BASE64=$(base64 -w 0 my-image.png)

    curl -X POST \
      "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
        "input": {
          "parts": [
            {
              "inlineData": {
                "mimeType": "image/png",
                "data": "'"${IMAGE_BASE64}"'"
              }
            },
            {
              "text": "Point to no more than 10 items in the image. The label returned should be an identifying name for the object detected. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": [y, x], \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000."
            }
          ]
        },
        "generation_config": {
          "thinking_config": {
            "thinking_level": "high"
          }
        }
      }'

The output will be a JSON array containing objects, each with a `point`
(normalized `[y, x]` coordinates) and a `label` identifying the object.

### JSON

    [
      {"point": [376, 508], "label": "small banana"},
      {"point": [287, 609], "label": "larger banana"},
      {"point": [223, 303], "label": "pink starfruit"},
      {"point": [435, 172], "label": "paper bag"},
      {"point": [270, 786], "label": "green plastic bowl"},
      {"point": [488, 775], "label": "metal measuring cup"},
      {"point": [673, 580], "label": "dark blue bowl"},
      {"point": [471, 353], "label": "light blue bowl"},
      {"point": [492, 497], "label": "bread"},
      {"point": [525, 429], "label": "lime"}
    ]

The following image is an example of how these points can be displayed:

## Tracking objects in a video

Gemini Robotics ER 2 can also analyze video frames to track objects
over time. See [Video inputs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video-understanding#supported-formats)
for a list of supported video formats.

### Python

    from google import genai

    client = genai.Client()

    uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file="my-video.mp4")

    prompt = """
              Point to the red ball in every frame where it appears.
              The answer should follow the json format: [{"point": [y, x],
              "label": <label>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format
              normalized to 0-1000. Return one entry per frame that contains
              the object.
            """

    image_response = client.interactions.create(
      model="gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
      input=[
        {
            "type": "video",
            "uri": uploaded_file.uri,
            "mime_type": uploaded_file.mime_type
        },
        {"type": "text", "text": prompt}
      ],
    )

    print(image_response.output_text)

## Object detection and bounding boxes

In addition to points, you can prompt the model to return 2D bounding boxes,
which provide more spatial detail for detected objects.

### Python

    from google import genai

    client = genai.Client()

    uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file="my-image.png")

    prompt = """
              Detect all objects in this image and return bounding boxes.
              The answer should follow the JSON format:
              [{"label": <label>, "y": <y_min>, "x": <x_min>,
                "y2": <y_max>, "x2": <x_max>}, ...]
              where coordinates are normalized to 0-1000.
            """

    image_response = client.interactions.create(
      model="gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
      input=[
        {
            "type": "image",
            "uri": uploaded_file.uri,
            "mime_type": uploaded_file.mime_type
        },
        {"type": "text", "text": prompt}
      ],
    )

    print(image_response.output_text)

## Trajectories

Gemini Robotics ER 2 can generate sequences of points that define a
trajectory, useful for guiding robot movement.

This example requests a trajectory to move a red pen to an organizer, including
an estimate of the intermediate waypoints. The code has been reduced to show
only the prompt.

### Python

    prompt = """
              Generate a trajectory for the robotic arm to pick up the red pen
              and place it in the organizer. Return a list of waypoints as JSON:
              [{"step": <int>, "point": [y, x], "action": <description>}, ...]
              where coordinates are normalized to 0-1000.
            """

## Making room for a laptop

This example shows how Gemini Robotics ER can reason about a space. The prompt
asks the model to identify which object needs to be moved to create
space for another item.

### Python

    from google import genai

    client = genai.Client()

    uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file="path/to/image-with-objects.jpg")

    prompt = """
              Point to the object that I need to remove to make room for my laptop
              The answer should follow the JSON format: [{"point": <point>,
              "label": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.
            """

    image_response = client.interactions.create(
      model="gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
      input=[
        {
            "type": "image",
            "uri": uploaded_file.uri,
            "mime_type": uploaded_file.mime_type
        },
        {"type": "text", "text": prompt}
      ],
    )

    print(image_response.output_text)

The response contains a 2D coordinate of the object that answers the user's
question, in this case, the object that should move to make room for a laptop.

    [
      {"point": [672, 301], "label": "The object that I need to remove to make room for my laptop"}
    ]

## Packing a lunch

The model can also provide instructions for multi-step tasks and point to
relevant objects for each step. This example shows how the model plans a series
of steps to pack a lunch bag.

### Python

    from google import genai

    client = genai.Client()

    uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file="path/to/image-of-lunch.jpg")

    prompt = """
              Explain how to pack the lunch box and lunch bag. Point to each
              object that you refer to. Each point should be in the format:
              [{"point": [y, x], "label": }], where the coordinates are
              normalized between 0-1000.
            """

    image_response = client.interactions.create(
      model="gemini-robotics-er-2-preview",
      input=[
        {
            "type": "image",
            "uri": uploaded_file.uri,
            "mime_type": uploaded_file.mime_type
        },
        {"type": "text", "text": prompt}
      ],
    )

    print(image_response.output_text)

The response of this prompt is a set of step by step instructions on how to pack
a lunch bag from the image input.

**Input image**

![An image of a lunch box and items to put into it](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/robotics/packing-lunch.png)

**Model output**

    Based on the image, here is a plan to pack the lunch box and lunch bag:

    1.  **Pack the fruit into the lunch box.** Place the [apple](apple), [banana](banana), [red grapes](red grapes), and [green grapes](green grapes) into the [blue lunch box](blue lunch box).
    2.  **Add the spoon to the lunch box.** Put the [blue spoon](blue spoon) inside the lunch box as well.
    3.  **Close the lunch box.** Secure the lid on the [blue lunch box](blue lunch box).
    4.  **Place the lunch box inside the lunch bag.** Put the closed [blue lunch box](blue lunch box) into the [brown lunch bag](brown lunch bag).
    5.  **Pack the remaining items into the lunch bag.** Place the [blue snack bar](blue snack bar) and the [brown snack bar](brown snack bar) into the [brown lunch bag](brown lunch bag).

    Here is the list of objects and their locations:
    *   [{"point": [899, 440], "label": "apple"}]
    *   [{"point": [814, 363], "label": "banana"}]
    *   [{"point": [727, 470], "label": "red grapes"}]
    *   [{"point": [675, 608], "label": "green grapes"}]
    *   [{"point": [706, 529], "label": "blue lunch box"}]
    *   [{"point": [864, 517], "label": "blue spoon"}]
    *   [{"point": [499, 401], "label": "blue snack bar"}]
    *   [{"point": [614, 705], "label": "brown snack bar"}]
    *   [{"point": [448, 501], "label": "brown lunch bag"}]
